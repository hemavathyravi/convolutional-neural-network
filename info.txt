CNN stands for Convolutional Neural Network, which is a class of deep neural networks commonly applied to analyze visual data. CNNs have proven highly effective in tasks such as image and video recognition, image classification, object detection, and more. 
They are particularly well-suited for tasks where the input data has a grid-like topology, such as images.
Keras Tuner is an open-source hyperparameter tuning library for TensorFlow's Keras. 
It helps you to optimize the hyperparameters of your deep learning models in order to improve their performance. 
Hyperparameter tuning involves finding the best combination of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, dropout rate, number of layers) to enhance the performance of your neural network.
